# Match-Transaction-Engine
The purpose of this project is to create an interface that allows for rapid checking of a massive transaction list against the SDN list. Other features would be review of the potential false positive list, and reduction of those reports with matching probability. Essentially, this engine will need to match all of transactions against the list below. Any insurance agency, banks and any one who does financial transactions on a state or federal level needs to do it. 

# Resources 
The current list for specially designated persons, which is a public resource. It is illegal for anyone in America to do business with anyone on this list.

# Current Methods 
Some insurance companies do it by substring matching which is a bad way as it leads to lots of false positives which leads to lots of noise.
